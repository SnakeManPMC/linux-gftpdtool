        `----------------------------------------'

                gftpdtool.cfg configuration file
		 
gftpdtool.cfg file, first line is where to create top files, later lines are
the maximum number of users to list in the various tops. pretty easy setup.


                example/ directory
		 
what is the example dir? here you can find files like tops.example.alup and
tops.example.alup.middle etc, the first file is footer for the alltime stat
and the .middle file is the actual line of how the users are shown.


		gftpdtool.dat datafile
		 
what is gftpdtool.dat file?  this file contains the HIGHSCORE records, its
plain text file and contains some sort of explanation of the record positions
in the lower part of the file. You dont need to bother about this file.


		parameters
		
the tool takes two parameters, one initializes the yeartop and the other is
used to add information to weektop/monthtop database. they are:
       .------------------------------------.
       |  /yeartop = yeartop initilization  |
       |  /wkuptop = week/monthtop addings  |
       `------------------------------------'     		
of course you only need to use the yeartop once a year (Jan 1st hmm?) but it
can be the date you start to run this tool if you do not follow the newyear.
weektop parameter should be used saturday night approx 23:58, BEFORE 00:00.


		using the gftpdtool
		 		    
using the program is simple, just run ./gftpdtool and you're all set. if all
works okay like they should, it generates files that match directly the files
that Jonni's excellent daemon uses. these are like tops.alltime.up for alltime
upload top and tops.monthly.up for this monts best uploaders top. Simple.
